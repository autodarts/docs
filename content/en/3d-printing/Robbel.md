## **Robbel3D DIY "Do it Yourself" Autodarts System**

This modular 3D-printed system positions three cameras at 120° angles around a dartboard. It enables reliable hit detection from multiple perspectives. The mounts are compatible with various cameras and lighting rings.

### **Compatible camera modules**

The system supports camera boards with dimensions of **32x32 mm** and a hole spacing of 28x28mm.

| Camera sensor | Manufacturer/brand | Resolution |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| OV9732 | HBV,GXIVision | 1MP (1280x720) |
| OV2710 | HBV | 2MP (1280x960) |
| OV2735 | GXIVision | 2MP (1280x960) |
| IMX179 | HBV,GXIVision | 8MP (1280x960) |

### **Supported lighting rings**

* Winmau Plasma
* Target Corona (mounted with adapter)
* Mission Torus270 (mounted with adapter)
* 3D-printed ring (360° closed or 270° open)

### **Prepared 3MF files**

A fully configured 3MF file is available for each ring variant. No more tedious searching for individual STL files.

| Ring/Variant         | Folder Name              |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Winmau Plasma        | 03 Winmau Plasma 3MF     |
| Target Corona        | 04 Target Corona 3MF     |
| Mission Torus270     | 05 Mission Torus 3MF     |
| DIY-Ring 360° closed | 01 DIY Ring 360° closed 3MF |
| DIY-Ring 270° open   | 02 DIY Ring 270° open 3MF |

### **Adapters for smaller rings**

Target Corona and Mission Torus270 have smaller outer diameters than the Winmau Plasma Ring and the 3D-printed ring. Special adapters bridge this gap and hold the camera mounts in the correct position.

## **Wall mounting: Four options**

### **Option 1 - 3D-printed base plate (recommended)**

* 7-piece solid base plate
* Description follows separately

**Ideal for anyone who has their own 3D printer.**

![Image 12](/3d-printing/images/robbel/12.jpg)]

## **Advantages of the 3D-printed base plate**

*  **Compatible with all common lighting rings**  
   (Winmau Plasma, Mission Torus270, Target Corona, DIY 3D ring)
* **Universal camera mounting system**
    - The camera arms always remain in the same position, regardless of which lighting ring you use.
* **Maximum stability**
    - Sophisticated plug-in system with cone and angle connections, no bending or twisting.
* **Neat cable routing**
    - Integrated cable channels with defined outputs and cable clamps
* **Easy wall mounting**
    - Thanks to centered main hole and template/PDF.

## **Wall mounting made easy**

* **Center hole** \= align to 173 cm bullseye height
* **Outer holes \=** 295 mm radius from the center
* **PDF** included in the Cults3D package  
  (or simply use the base plate itself for marking after you have finished screwing it together)

**Assembly & Parts**

The base plate consists of 7 parts that are screwed together:

### **Part 1: "Base"**

* Central plate on which the dartboard is mounted.
* Two mounts available:
    * Standard dartboard mount (sheet metal)
    * Bulls dartboard mount
* Cable outlets & new holes for Karella sound insulation system integrated.

### **Part 2: "3x middle arms"**

* Attached to the base with 3x M4x14 mm screws each.
* Includes M6 threaded inserts for the RotaLock dartboard tensioners.
* Advantage: Tensioners no longer rotate with the dartboard because they are fixed in the base plate.

### **Part 3: "3x foot mounts"**

* Attached to the center arms with 2x M3x10 mm screws.
* M4 threaded inserts for screwing camera mounts with millimeter precision.
* 45° countersunk hole for wall mounting.

## **Overview: Threaded inserts per part**

### **Part 1 "Base"**

* 3x M4 for Bulls mount
* 9x M4 for connection to center arms
* 4x M3 for standard mount

### **Part 2 "Middle arms"**

* 1x M6 each for RotaLock tensioners

### **Part 3 "Foot mounts"**

* 2x M3 for attachment to center arms
* 3x M4 for mounting the camera mounts

## **Screw list (DIN912)**

| Screw | Quantity | Intended use          |

| M4x14 mm | 9x | Camera mount          |
| M3x10 mm | 6x | Foot <-> Middle arm   |
| M3x10 mm | 2x | Standard-Holder       |
| M4x10-16 mm | 3x | Bulls-Holder          |

For wall mounting:
