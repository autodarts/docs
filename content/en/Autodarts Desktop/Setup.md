## Create Board
Now it's time to set up a Board. You can either create a new Board or claim an existing one. You will only see the 'Claim Board' option if you have already created a board within your Autodarts.io Account.

Claiming a board will unregister it from other devices that might be using it

## Camera Setup
In the next step, you will be able to select your cameras, change the resolution, framerate, and the camera standby time. Beside the dropdown for your camera selection, you will find a button to flip your cameras by 180 degrees.

## Calibration
In this step the algorithm will attempt to calibrate your Board automatically. Locate the '20' field and mark it in red. If it's not possible to locate the '20' field correctly, you can adjust it manually by clicking the arrow buttons below the camera view.

Please note that starting from version 0.24.0, the algorithm takes care of possible distortion in your camera lens. That means, with software versions above 0.24.0, you do **not** have to manually adjust distortion if needed.

## Test
Now it's time to test if everything went well. Throw your darts and check if they are recognized correctly.
