Autocorrect (AI): Smarter Scores, Cleaner Games,
Say goodbye to disputes! Our groundbreaking AI-assisted feature replaces manual corrections, reviewing camera footage to guarantee a fair and trustworthy score on every throw.

More Trust: Eliminates manual bias and potential disputes.,
How it Works: Players request a correction; the AI analyzes the video and adjusts the score only if an error is detected.

You can use the Referee by clicking the referee symbol during a running match.
