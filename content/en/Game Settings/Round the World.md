# Basic Game Rules

Round the world is a easy variant of Around the clock. The objective of the game is to hit each number on the dartboard in sequential order. It doesn't matter how many times the target field is hit; it's sufficient to hit the field once to complete it. For each hit field, the corresponding points are added.
