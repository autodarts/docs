# Basic Game Rules

The main goal of Cricket is to hit, the numbers 15 to 20 and bullseye on the dartboard.

![Cricket Settings](/game-settings/images/cricket.png)

- Mode: </br>

- Normal:</br>
Players take turns throwing three darts per turn. Players can mark fields by hitting 
numbers 20 through 15 and the bullseye (Single field counts 1 mark, double field counts 2 marks, 
triple field counts 3 marks).To close out a number, a player must hit it three times. Once a player 
closes out a number, they "own" that number, and it becomes worth points only to them. No other player can 
score on a closed number.</br>
Winning the Game:</br>
The game ends when a player/team closes out all numbers (20 to 15 and bullseye) before their opponents.
The player who scored the most points will win the game.</br>

- Cut Throat:</br>
In Cricket darts, "cut-throat" is a variation of the game where players can target their opponents' numbers to score points.
In addition to Normal mode youre opponent can score points for you. If Player "A" has not closed the number 20, and if Player "B" hits the number 20 four times, then Player "A" gets 20 points. So, if you hit your target number more than three times, your opponent receives the points you hit too much, provided they haven't already closed out the number. The game typically ends when all numbers (20 to 15 and bullseye) have been closed out by at least one player. The player with the highest total points wins.

- Max rounds </br>
With this option, you choose the maximum number of game rounds.

- Bull-off </br>
Off: Bull-off mode is turned off. </br>
Normal: The player whose dart is nearest to the bull starts the game.</br>
Official: The player who hitting the bull start the game.</br>
If both players hit the bull, the Bull-off is redone.

- Match mode </br>
Off: The game must be finished manually; in this mode, there is no leg or set limit. </br>
Legs: If you choose this mode, you can set a limit on the number of legs to be played (currently it's limited to "first to 11 legs").</br>
Sets: If you choose this mode, you can set a limit on the number of sets to be played (currently it's limited to "first to 7 sets"). In this mode, you can also choose whether a set is won by winning 2 or 3 sets.</br>
