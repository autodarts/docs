Autodarts supports a wide range of webcams. However, it is not recommended to just buy the cheapest cameras available. Based on the experiences of the community, we have already curated a selection of suitable cameras.

First, here are a few factors to consider when choosing a camera.

- FOV - The field of view should be between 80° and 110°.
- Lens should have no distortion.
- Low power consumption.
- Length of the cable (the shorter the cable, the better).
- Stable framerate around 30 FPS.
- The most common resolutions are between 640x480 and 1280x720 (higher resolutions seem to have no effect on accuracy).



With most cameras, it is relatively easy to exchange the lenses afterwards to achieve the desired field of view.

Many cameras have distortion, but this can be compensated for with the right lenses.
We also offer software that can be used to remove the distortion via software.

When considering power consumption, it is important to check the USB standards and the manufacturer's information for the platform you want to play on.
In some cases, using a USB hub with an external power supply could help.

| Specification | Voltage | Amperage | Power |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- | ----- |
| USB 1.0/1.1   | 5V      | 100mA    | 0,5W  |
| USB 2.0       | 5V      | 500mA    | 2,5W  |
| USB 3.o/3.1   | 5V      | 900mA    | 4,5W  |

There are even more factors that can play a role when it comes to cameras.
However, these are the most important.
Here are a few examples from the community that are already being used by our users and delivering good results.
