The software is designed to run on most hardware, and should work on any system with equivalent or better specifications.
However, it's important to note that hardware and software are closely interconnected.
So, before selecting an operating system, make sure that the minimum system requirements are met.

# Hardware

## Computing unit

Depending on what your system needs to be able to do, you should pay attention to the following hardware requirements when selecting the ThinClient / Raspberry Pi (4/5) / Mac:

## Cameras

For cameras, you should consider purchasing OV9732 with a 100Â° viewing angle. These cameras work great and offer a good price-performance ratio. Other cameras should also work. Before buying, please visit the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/autodarts) server. PLEASE use the search function before you Post "Is this camera working"!

## Dartboard illumination

You can buy ready-made solutions like the "Winmau Plasma" or "Target Corona." You can also build your own ring. For this, please check out the 3D Printing [3D Printing section](https://docs.autodarts.io/3d-printing/), where you can find STL files for the Winmau Plasma ring. Additionally, you can find files to construct your own ring.
