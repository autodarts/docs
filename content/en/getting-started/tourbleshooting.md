In this section, we’ll go over the best way to share details with us so we can help fine-tune your detection and accuracy.

To get started, please ensure you have a Board Client installed (such as Autodarts Desktop) and that the application is currently open and running on your computer.

Next, access the Board Manager by entering localhost:3180 into your browser's address bar. You should then see the page pictured below.

Head over to the Vision tab in the navigation bar. From here, you can monitor your camera feeds in real-time.

Within the Vision view, you can toggle between several tabs to monitor your setup:

- Live: Provides a real-time view of your camera streams.
- Motion: Displays detected activity (such as a dart hitting the board). This indicator should typically be green; if it turns yellow, the system has triggered a "takeout" detection.
- Movement: Highlights any physical movement captured within the camera’s field of view.
- Dart: Tracks detected darts on the board. Each row corresponds to a specific throw (e.g., the first row represents your first dart, the second row your second, and so on).

To help us troubleshoot misdetections as quickly as possible, please include screenshots of each of these tabs. This gives our team the full picture needed to fine-tune your setup.
