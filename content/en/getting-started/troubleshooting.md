In this section, we’ll go over the best way to share details so others can help fine-tune your detection and accuracy.

To get started, please ensure you have a Board Client installed (such as Autodarts Desktop) and that the application is currently open and running on your computer.

Next, open the Board Manager. You can find detailed access instructions in the [Board Manager]({{< relref "how-to-play/BoardManager.md" >}}) guide. Once it is open, your screen should look like this:

Head over to the Vision tab in the navigation bar. From here, you can monitor your camera feeds in real-time.

Within the Vision view, you can toggle between several tabs to monitor your setup:

- Live: Provides a real-time view of your camera streams.
- Motion: Displays detected activity (such as a dart hitting the board). This indicator should typically be green; if it turns yellow, the system has triggered a "takeout" detection.
- Movement: Highlights any physical movement compared to the last image.
- Dart: Tracks detected darts on the board. Each row corresponds to a specific throw (e.g., the first row represents your first dart, the second row your second, and so on).

To help troubleshoot misdetections as quickly as possible, please include screenshots of each of these tabs. This gives others the full picture needed to fine-tune your setup.
